If access is needed, associates can raise an iQuery ticket .\n\n- **Management Applications**: ESS provides access to various management applications, including the Budget Management System .\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the specific documents or links provided in the retrieved data.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1.

    "answer": "**Issues with Generating Data Analysis Report (DAR)**\n\nIf you are facing issues with generating the Data Analysis Report (DAR), consider the following tips to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Project Applicability**: Ensure that the project is applicable for the Data Analysis Report (DAR).\n\n2. **Latest Computation Date**: Check the latest computation date to confirm that the data is up-to-date.\n\n3. **MPP File Publication**: Verify if the MPP file was published with the actual work included.\n\n4. **Daily Computation Success**: Ensure that the daily computation has been 100% successful.\n\n5. **Last Published Date**: Check the last published date and wait for 24 hours before attempting to generate the report again.\n\n6. **Quarter of Report Generation**: Confirm which quarter the report is being generated for, as this may affect the data availability.\n\nIf task approvals have occurred on the same day, they will not reflect in the DAR report immediately. You should first publish the project schedule file and then refer to the DAR report the following day for the effort information to be reflected. Additionally, if the task spans multiple months, the report data will also span across those months.\n\nIf the issue persists, please raise a [Service-Now ticket](https://boschindia.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9bd938621bcfd510ce4f628ee54bcb05&referrer=popular_items) with the following details:\n- Project ID\n- Project Name\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1.
