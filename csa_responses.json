    "answer": "**Issues with Generating Data Analysis Report (DAR)**\n\nIf you are facing issues with generating the Data Analysis Report (DAR), consider the following tips to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Project Applicability**: Ensure that the project is applicable for the Data Analysis Report (DAR).\n\n2. **Latest Computation Date**: Check the latest computation date to confirm that the data is up-to-date.\n\n3. **MPP File Publication**: Verify if the MPP file was published with the actual work included.\n\n4. **Daily Computation Success**: Ensure that the daily computation has been 100% successful.\n\n5. **Last Published Date**: Check the last published date and wait for 24 hours before attempting to generate the report again.\n\n6. **Quarter of Report Generation**: Confirm which quarter the report is being generated for, as this may affect the data availability.\n\nIf task approvals have occurred on the same day, they will not reflect in the DAR report immediately. You should first publish the project schedule file and then refer to the DAR report the following day for the effort information to be reflected. Additionally, if the task spans multiple months, the report data will also span across those months.\n\nIf the issue persists, please raise a [Service-Now ticket](https://boschindia.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9bd938621bcfd510ce4f628ee54bcb05&referrer=popular_items) with the following details:\n- Project ID\n- Project Name\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1.

Frequently, some negotiation ensues, often resulting in a reworking of \nthe estimate. Ideally, the final test estimate represents the best-possible balance of organizational and \nproject goals in the areas of quality, schedule, budget, and features.  \n \nIt is important to remember that any estimate is based on the information available at the time it was \nprepared.  Early in a project, the information may be quite limited.  In addition, information that is \navailable early in a project may change over time.  In order to remain accurate, estimates should be \nupdated to reflect new and changed information.  \n\n2.6 Defining and Using Test Metrics \n\nA management clich\u00e9 says that what gets measured gets done.  \naHR0cHM6Ly9iZ3N3aGV5Ym9zY2h0ZXN0MDAxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9oci1wb2xpY3ktdXBkYXRlZC9DVEFMX1RNXzIwMTJfU3lsbGFidXNfdjIuMC5wZGY1",

And, even if the team members \nare perfect for the current project, they may not be the perfect mix for the next project.  The Test \nManager should hire people who are intelligent, curious, adaptable, willing to work, able to work \neffectively as part of a team, and willing and able to learn.  Even though that set of perfect individuals \nis probably not available, a strong team can be built by balancing the strengths and weaknesses of the \nindividuals.  \n \nUsing the skills assessment spreadsheet, the Test Manager can identify where the team is strong and \nwhere it is weak.  This information forms the foundation of a training and skills development plan.  \nStarting with the weaknesses that have the greatest impact on the team\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency, \nthe Test Manager should decide how to address those areas.  One approach is training, e.g., send \npeople to a training course, have training sessions in-house, develop custom training, use e-learning \ncourses.  Another approach is self-study, e.g., books, webinars, Internet resources. Yet another \napproach is cross-training, e.g., assigning someone with an interest in learning a skill to work with \nsomeone who already has the skill on a task requiring that skill, having local experts give brief \npresentations on their area of expertise, etc.  (Mentoring is a similar approach, where a person who is \nnew to a role is paired with a senior person who has had that role, and the senior person acts as an \nongoing resource to provide advice and assistance.)  In addition to addressing weakness, the Test \nManager should remember to leverage the strengths identified in the skills assessment as part of the \ntraining and skills development plan.

    "answer": "**Editing Published Demand**\n\nOnce demand has been published in Planisware, it cannot be directly edited. If you encounter a situation where you need to make changes to a published demand, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create an iQuery Ticket**: Since editing published demand is not allowed, you will need to raise an iQuery ticket. Include all relevant details about the demand that needs to be edited.\n\n2. **Provide Necessary Information**: In your ticket, make sure to specify the demand ID, the changes required, and any other pertinent information that will help in processing your request.\n\n3. **Await Response**: After submitting your ticket, wait for a response from the support team, who will guide you on the next steps or make the necessary adjustments.\n\nThis process ensures that any required changes to published demand are handled appropriately.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. What types of changes can be made to demand before it is published?\n2. How long does it typically take to process an iQuery ticket for demand changes?\n3.

Opportunity number is also captured in Sales Order of RBEB. With this data, invoiced data for a particular period can be captured.

As per accounting standards, there is no revenue recognition for milestone based billing until completion of milestone and acceptance from the customer. Hence, no unbilled is considered as revenue for Fixed Price billing . 2\\. Unbilled for T&amp;M is only for one month for the purpose of financial &amp; management reporting; basically when CTG reports revenue (billed + unbilled) to Management they will consider what is actually invoiced as of last working day of the month plus what is allocated, but not billed for the current month. Essentially, there will only be one unbilled record created for a given employee for a given month. The case applies for both normal T&amp;M billing and Customer approved timesheet billing 3\\. Revamp will allow unbilled to be made available for the purpose of actual billing to customer till end of the year since Organization does not want to lose revenue.  \n\nQuestion 11) How is Pass-thru billing handled for (RBEB, EBS-MX, RBVH) resources deployed on 3rd party projects?  \nAnswer: RBVH/RBMX resources will be billed on Pass-Thru process similar to any other project. \naHR0cHM6Ly9iZ3N3aGV5Ym9zY2h0ZXN0MDAxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9oci1wb2xpY3ktdXBkYXRlZC9PMkklMjAtJTIwRkFRcy5kb2N40",

    "question": "What is the outcome of performing recertification?",
    "answer": "**Outcome of Performing Recertification**\n\nThe outcome of performing recertification includes several key benefits:\n\n1. **Mitigation of Risks**: Recertification helps to mitigate risks for both associates and the organization by ensuring that access rights are appropriate and necessary for users' current roles. This process prevents unauthorized access rights from being retained unnecessarily .\n\n2. **Verification of Access Rights**: It verifies that users have the correct access rights that align with their job responsibilities, thereby enhancing security and compliance with access rights policies .\n\n3. **Identification of Gaps**: Regular recertification checks allow organizations to promptly identify and address any gaps or vulnerabilities in their access control systems, ensuring that access rights are managed effectively .\n\n4. **Compliance Assurance**: By conducting timely reviews and reapprovals of access rights, recertification ensures compliance with organizational policies and regulations, such as the Access Management central directive .\n\n5. **Improved Access Management**: The process supports better access management by allowing for the revocation of access rights that are no longer necessary, thus streamlining the overall access control process .\n\nOverall, recertification is a critical component of access management that enhances security, compliance, and operational efficiency within an organization.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. How often should recertification checks be performed?\n2. What specific steps are involved in the recertification process?\n3. What happens if access rights are found to be inappropriate during recertification?",

    "answer": "To reopen a subproject in PROMISE, you need to follow the specific procedures outlined in the system. Here are the steps you should consider:\n\n1. **Check the Status**: Ensure that the subproject is in a status that allows it to be reopened.

    "question": "Hey BGSW what is NPS",
    "answer": "**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used metric for measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction. It helps organizations understand how their customers perceive their products or services. Here are some key points about NPS:\n\n- **Purpose**: NPS gauges the likelihood of customers recommending a company's products or services to others. It is a valuable tool for assessing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n- **Scoring System**: Customers are typically asked to rate their likelihood of recommending the company on a scale from 0 to 10. Based on their responses, customers are categorized into three groups:\n  - **Promoters (score 9-10)**: Loyal customers who are likely to recommend the company.\n  - **Passives (score 7-8)**: Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who may switch to competitors.\n  - **Detractors (score 0-6)**: Unhappy customers who can harm the brand through negative word-of-mouth.\n\n- **Calculation**: NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. The formula is:\n  \n  \\[\n  NPS = \\% \\text{Promoters} - \\% \\text{Detractors}\n  \\]\n\n- **Interpretation**: The resulting score can range from -100 to +100. A positive score indicates more Promoters than Detractors, while a negative score suggests the opposite.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to resources on customer experience and satisfaction metrics.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. How can businesses improve their NPS?\n2. What are some common methods for collecting NPS feedback?\n3. Can you explain how NPS relates to customer retention strategies?",

    "question": "Submit option is not available in Timesheet?  ",
    "answer": "**Submit Option Unavailability in Timesheet**\n\nIf the submit option is not available in your timesheet, it may be due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Timesheet Closure**: Timesheets are regularly closed. For instance, timesheets of CW1 are closed on Monday of CW3, and timesheets of CW2 are closed on Monday of CW4. Once the timesheet is closed, both the \"Save\" and \"Turn in final timesheet\" options will be disabled .\n\n2. **Filters in Timesheet Entry Screen**: Check if there are any existing filters applied in the timesheet entry screen under the \"Options\" menu. If filters are present, remove them by selecting the \"no filter\" option to see if the submit option reappears .\n\n3. **Technical Issues**: If you are facing technical issues or if the above steps do not resolve the problem, it is advisable to raise a [Service-now ticket](https://boschindia.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9bd938621bcfd510ce4f628ee54bcb05&referrer=popular_items) with appropriate details, such as your Employee Number and Project ID .\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. What should I do if my timesheet is rejected?\n2. How can I recall a timesheet after submitting it?\n3. Are there any specific deadlines for submitting timesheets?",

No, Project ID etc...).  \n\nQuestion 818) Though the actual work is available, phase wise effort is appearing blank.  \nAnswer: Please check if there are any existing filters in the timesheet entry screen under \"Options\" menu. If there are any filters available, remove the filters by setting \"no filter\" option and check if the task is appearing. If there are no filters and still the task does not appear, please raise an [ Service- now](https://boschindia.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&amp;sys_id=9bd938621bcfd510ce4f628ee54bcb05&amp;referrer=popular_items) ticket with the below details:   1\\. Project id   2\\. Relevant Screenshot  \n\nQuestion 819) The effort entered by associates is 0 hrs, then in summary tasks of the Microsoft Project Professional file the actual finish date is updating as NA.  \nAnswer: Please follow the below steps to ensure that Actual Finish date gets updated properly. Please note that these steps have to be performed on child tasks only.   1\\. Insert the columns \"Remaining Work\", \"Remaining Duration\" and \"% Complete\"   2\\. For the completed tasks, set \"Remaining Work\" = 0.   3\\. After 2) is completed, \"Remaining Duration\" may automatically become \"0\". Else, set it to \"0\".   4\\. After 3) is completed, \"% Complete\" may become automatically \"100%\". If it is shown as \"0%\" or \"99%\", set it manually to \"100%\".   Once this is done for all the child tasks, the \"Actual Finish\" of the summary task will get populated.  \n\nQuestion 820) Can the closed timesheet be reopened for submission?  \nAnswer: If timesheet period is closed then it is possible to regularize the efforts by applying Efforts Not Booked (ENB) leave type in ESS. For the days on which you have worked but could not submit timesheet, you can use this option after 1 week from the Timesheet Closure Date in PRIME. \naHR0cHM6Ly9iZ3N3aGV5Ym9zY2h0ZXN0MDAxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9oci1wb2xpY3ktdXBkYXRlZC9QcmltZSUyMC0lMjBGQVFzLmRvY3g1",

    "question": "Review Defect Leakage?  ",
    "answer": "**Review Defect Leakage**\n\nReview Defect Leakage is a metric used to measure the effectiveness of the review process in software development. It quantifies the total number of defects that escape the review phase and are found in later stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). \n\nThe formula for calculating Review Defect Leakage (RDL) is as follows:\n\n\\[ \nRDL = \\frac{(TD + DD)}{(TD + DD + RD)} \\times 100 \n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- **TD** = Test defects\n- **DD** = Delivered defects\n- **RD** = Review defects\n\nThis metric helps in understanding how many defects were not caught during the review process and were instead found later, indicating areas for improvement in the review practices.\n\nFor a detailed understanding of Review Defect Leakage, you can refer to this [link](https://kor2vm0022.apac.bosch.com/stages/#/workspace/4300/_vv/process/guidance/_p4xE0K2ftQm5GpIOgXHzvA) .\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. How can we improve the Review Defect Leakage rate in our projects?\n2. What are the common causes of defects leaking through the review process?\n3. Are there specific tools or practices recommended for effective defect review?",

    "question": "Hey BGSW what is NPS",
    "answer": "Hello! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n**NPS** stands for **Net Promoter Score**. It is a widely used metric for measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction. The NPS is calculated based on responses to a single question: \n\n*\"On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?\"*\n\n**Key Points about NPS:**\n\n- **Scoring**: Respondents are categorized into three groups:\n  - **Promoters (score 9-10)**: Loyal customers who are likely to recommend the company.\n  - **Passives (score 7-8)**: Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.\n  - **Detractors (score 0-6)**: Unhappy customers who can damage the brand through negative word-of-mouth.\n\n- **Calculation**: The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. The formula is:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{NPS} = \\% \\text{Promoters} - \\% \\text{Detractors}\n  \\]\n\n- **Interpretation**: The score can range from -100 to +100. A positive score indicates more Promoters than Detractors, which is generally a good sign of customer loyalty.\n\nFor more detailed insights on NPS, you might want to explore resources related to customer experience management.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. How can companies improve their NPS?\n2. What are some common methods for collecting NPS feedback?\n3. How does NPS compare to other customer satisfaction metrics?",

The NPS is calculated based on responses to a single question: \n\n*\"On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?\"*\n\n**Key Points about NPS:**\n\n- **Promoters (score 9-10)**: These are loyal customers who are likely to make repeat purchases and refer others.\n  \n- **Passives (score 7-8)**: These customers are satisfied but not enthusiastic enough to be considered promoters.\n\n- **Detractors (score 0-6)**: These customers are unhappy and can potentially harm your brand through negative word-of-mouth.\n\nThe NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. This score can help organizations understand their customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to resources on customer experience management.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. How can a company improve its NPS?\n2. What are some common methods for collecting NPS feedback?\n3. How does NPS compare to other customer satisfaction metrics?",

    "question": "Hey BGSW what is NPS",
    "answer": "**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used metric for measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is based on a single question survey that asks customers how likely they are to recommend a company's product or service to others, typically on a scale from 0 to 10. \n\n**Key Components of NPS:**\n\n- **Promoters (Score 9-10)**: These are loyal customers who are likely to make repeat purchases and refer others.\n\n- **Passives (Score 7-8)**: These customers are satisfied but not enthusiastic enough to be considered promoters. They are vulnerable to competitive offerings.\n\n- **Detractors (Score 0-6)**: These customers are unhappy and can damage your brand through negative word-of-mouth.\n\n**Calculating NPS:**\n\nNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters:\n\n\\[ \\text{NPS} = \\% \\text{Promoters} - \\% \\text{Detractors} \\]\n\nThe score can range from -100 to +100, with higher scores indicating better customer loyalty.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to resources on customer experience management or specific NPS guides.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions**\n\n- How can businesses improve their NPS?\n- What are some common methods for collecting NPS feedback?\n- How does NPS compare to other customer satisfaction metrics?",

    "question": "Hey BGSW what is NPS",
    "answer": "**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used metric that measures customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is based on a single question survey that asks customers how likely they are to recommend a company's product or service to others, typically on a scale from 0 to 10. \n\n**Key Components of NPS:**\n\n- **Promoters (Score 9-10)**: These are loyal customers who are likely to make repeat purchases and refer others to the company.\n\n- **Passives (Score 7-8)**: These customers are satisfied but not enthusiastic. They are vulnerable to competitive offerings.\n\n- **Detractors (Score 0-6)**: These customers are unhappy and can damage the brand through negative word-of-mouth.\n\n**Calculating NPS:**\n\nNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters:\n\n\\[ \\text{NPS} = \\% \\text{Promoters} - \\% \\text{Detractors} \\]\n\nThe score can range from -100 to +100, with higher scores indicating better customer loyalty.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to resources on customer experience metrics.\n\n**Suggested follow-up questions:**\n\n1. How can businesses improve their NPS?\n2. What are some common methods for collecting NPS feedback?\n3. How does NPS compare to other customer satisfaction metrics?",
